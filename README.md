# Jilch

Clojure ZeroMQ Library using jeromq, it is a direct port of zilch.

## But why ?

Wanted to see if I could port zilch to jeromq in less than 5 minutes.
It was that easy (well, jilch is that good).

## Installation

Put this in your project.clj, then `lein deps`, and you are good to go, no more messin'
with native deps.

```clojure
[jilch "0.1.0"]
```
